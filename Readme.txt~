Welcome to SlideOver!

This is Jacob Klinker and I's SlideOver Messaging app. It is a part of our Sliding Messaging Project, but we have decided to open source this part of our and put it on the play store for free so that other people can contribute and see how things are done.

This source is a little bit messy right now and it isn't commented very much, if at all in some places. Cleanup will come later, but you're looking at the first real contribution to Android by an 18 year old kid (me haha) - so don't judge to badly, I can say that I have gotten much better now!

Like I said, cleanup will come when I have more time, for now, you will just have to dig a little!

This project only has two dependencies:

1.) ColorPickerPreference - We modifidied this a little it so it has been packaged along with this project.
2.) Android-smsmms - This is Jacob's library for sending SMS and MMS messaging. With this app we only showcase the SMS though. It can be found here: http://gitub.com/Klinker41/android-smsmms


That's it for now, dive in and see what you can do. I will merge all this back to Sliding Messaging as well if any contributions are made here!

Cheers and enjoy!
